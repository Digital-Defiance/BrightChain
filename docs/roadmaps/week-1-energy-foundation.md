# Energy Economy Implementation - Week 1 Progress

## What We Built Today

### ✅ Core Foundation Complete

We've implemented the **foundation** of the energy economy system:

#### 1. **Energy Constants** (`energyConsts.ts`)
- Trial credits for new users: 1000 Joules
- Computation costs (hashing, encryption, signing)
- Storage costs (per GB per day)
- Network costs (bandwidth)
- PoW difficulty range (8-24 bits)

#### 2. **Operation Types** (`enumerations/operationType.ts`)
- Expanded from 1 to 40+ operation types
- Block operations (store, retrieve, delete, verify)
- CBL operations
- Whitening operations
- Encryption operations
- BrightTrust operations
- Messaging operations
- Reputation operations
- Network operations

#### 3. **Operation Cost** (`operationCost.ts`)
- Tracks computation, storage, network, and PoW costs
- Calculates total Joules
- Utility methods (zero, add)

#### 4. **Energy Account** (`energyAccount.ts`)
- Balance tracking (current, earned, spent, reserved)
- Reputation score (0.0 to 1.0)
- Trial credits for new users
- Reserve/release for operations
- Charge/credit for transactions
- Serialization (toDto/fromDto, toJson/fromJson)

#### 5. **Energy Account Store** (`stores/energyAccountStore.ts`)
- In-memory storage for accounts
- Get/set/delete operations
- GetOrCreate with automatic trial credits
- Follows existing SimpleStore patterns

#### 6. **Energy Ledger** (`stores/energyLedger.ts`)
- Transaction audit trail
- Indexed by member ID
- Time-range queries
- Complete transaction history

#### 7. **Tests** (`energyAccount.spec.ts`)
- Account creation with trial credits
- Reserve/release/charge/credit operations
- Reputation updates
- Serialization round-trips
- Store operations

## How It Works

### New User Flow
```typescript
// 1. User joins network
const memberId = member.id;

// 2. Create account with trial credits
const account = EnergyAccount.createTrial(memberId);
// account.balance = 1000 Joules
// account.reputation = 0.5 (neutral)

// 3. Store in account store
accountStore.set(account);
```

### Operation Flow
```typescript
// 1. Calculate operation cost
const cost = new OperationCost(
  0.002,  // computation
  15.0,   // storage
  0.03,   // network
  0.8     // PoW based on reputation
);

// 2. Check if user can afford
if (account.canAfford(cost.totalJoules)) {
  // 3. Reserve energy
  account.reserve(cost.totalJoules);
  
  // 4. Perform operation
  await performOperation();
  
  // 5. Charge energy
  account.charge(cost.totalJoules);
  account.release(cost.totalJoules);
}
```

### Transaction Tracking
```typescript
// Record transaction in ledger
const tx: EnergyTransaction = {
  id: txChecksum,
  timestamp: new Date(),
  source: userMemberId,
  destination: providerMemberId,
  amount: cost.totalJoules,
  operationType: OperationType.BLOCK_STORE,
  blockId: blockChecksum,
  metadata: {
    dataSize: 1048576,  // 1 MB
    duration: 30,        // 30 days
    redundancy: 3,       // 3 copies
  },
  signature: userSignature,
};

ledger.add(tx);
```

## What's Next (Week 2)

### Storage Contracts
- [ ] StorageContract interface
- [ ] Contract creation with energy payment
- [ ] Expiration tracking
- [ ] Link to block storage
- [ ] Auto-renewal logic

### Integration
- [ ] Add energy checks to BlockService
- [ ] Charge for block storage
- [ ] Credit providers for serving blocks
- [ ] Track energy in block metadata

## Testing

Run the tests:
```bash
npx nx test brightchain-lib --testFile=energyAccount.spec.ts
```

Expected results:
- ✅ Account creation with trial credits
- ✅ Balance operations (reserve, charge, credit)
- ✅ Reputation updates
- ✅ Serialization
- ✅ Store operations

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Trial Credits**
- New users get 1000 Joules automatically
- Enough for initial exploration
- Prevents barrier to entry
- Can be adjusted based on testing

### 2. **Neutral Reputation**
- New users start at 0.5 (neutral)
- Not penalized initially
- Not rewarded initially
- Earn reputation through behavior

### 3. **Reserve/Charge Pattern**
- Reserve energy before operation
- Prevents race conditions
- Charge after operation completes
- Release if operation fails

### 4. **Immutable Transaction History**
- Ledger is append-only
- Complete audit trail
- Indexed for fast queries
- Supports compliance/debugging

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems
- ✅ Member system (memberId)
- ✅ Checksum (transaction IDs)
- ✅ Store patterns (SimpleStore, ArrayStore)
- ✅ Serialization (toDto/fromDto)

### Future Integration
- ⏳ BlockService (charge for storage)
- ⏳ CBLService (charge for CBL operations)
- ⏳ MessageService (charge for messaging)
- ⏳ BrightTrustService (charge for BrightTrust ops)

## Success Metrics

### Week 1 Goals: ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Energy constants defined
- [x] Account system working
- [x] Transaction tracking working
- [x] Tests passing
- [x] Documentation complete

### Week 2 Goals
- [ ] Storage contracts implemented
- [ ] Integration with BlockService
- [ ] End-to-end energy flow working
- [ ] Cost calculation service

## Notes

This is a **minimal viable implementation** that:
- Works with existing BrightChain patterns
- Provides foundation for full economic model
- Can be extended incrementally
- Doesn't break existing functionality

**You now have energy tracking!** 🎉

Next week, we'll connect it to actual storage operations and make the economy come alive.
