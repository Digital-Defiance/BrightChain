# Node Management and Voting Systems in BrightChain

## Node Participation

### Node Types

1. Regular Storage Nodes

   - Store OFFS blocks
   - Maintain high availability
   - Earn credits through storage contribution
   - Participate in data replication

2. Quorum Nodes
   - Higher trust level
   - Store sensitive data
   - Participate in governance
   - Handle identity management

### Node States

```typescript
enum NodeState {
  ONLINE,
  SCHEDULED_SHUTDOWN,
  EMERGENCY_SHUTDOWN,
  OFFLINE,
  PERMANENTLY_OFFLINE,
}

interface NodeStatus {
  state: NodeState;
  lastSeen: Date;
  plannedDowntime?: {
    start: Date;
    expectedDuration: number;
    permanent: boolean;
  };
  storageMetrics: {
    totalSpace: number;
    usedSpace: number;
    reservedSpace: number;
  };
  reliability: {
    uptime: number;
    successfulReplications: number;
    failedReplications: number;
  };
}
```

### Shutdown Process

1. Graceful Shutdown

   ```typescript
   interface ShutdownRequest {
     nodeId: GuidV4;
     shutdownTime: Date;
     expectedDuration?: number;
     permanent: boolean;
     affectedBlocks: {
       blockId: Buffer;
       priority: number;
       replicationStatus: 'PENDING' | 'IN_PROGRESS' | 'COMPLETED';
     }[];
   }
   ```

2. Emergency Shutdown
   - Immediate offline state
   - Network must handle data recovery
   - Reliability score impacted

## Data Availability

### Replication Management

```typescript
interface ReplicationPolicy {
  minimumCopies: number;
  targetCopies: number;
  maximumCopies: number;
  geographicSpread: boolean;
  priorityLevels: {
    CRITICAL: number;
    HIGH: number;
    MEDIUM: number;
    LOW: number;
  };
}

interface ReplicationJob {
  blockId: Buffer;
  priority: number;
  currentCopies: number;
  targetNodes: GuidV4[];
  deadline: Date;
  status: 'PENDING' | 'IN_PROGRESS' | 'COMPLETED' | 'FAILED';
}
```

### Node Selection

```typescript
interface NodeSelectionCriteria {
  reliability: number;
  availableSpace: number;
  geographicLocation?: string;
  networkLatency: number;
  currentLoad: number;
  specializations?: string[];
}
```

## Voting Systems

### 1. Quorum Voting

```typescript
interface QuorumVote {
  voteId: GuidV4;
  type: 'DOCUMENT_RECONSTRUCTION' | 'MEMBER_ADDITION' | 'MEMBER_REMOVAL';
  initiator: GuidV4;
  proposal: {
    action: string;
    parameters: Map<string, any>;
    justification: string;
  };
  deadline: Date;
  votes: Map<
    GuidV4,
    {
      decision: boolean;
      signature: SignatureBuffer;
      timestamp: Date;
    }
  >;
  threshold: number;
  status: 'OPEN' | 'APPROVED' | 'REJECTED' | 'EXPIRED';
}
```

### 2. Paillier-Based Voting

```typescript
interface PollDocument {
  pollId: GuidV4;
  creator: BrightChainMember;
  question: string;
  options: string[];
  startTime: Date;
  endTime: Date;
  votingKey: Buffer;
  status: 'SETUP' | 'ACTIVE' | 'TALLYING' | 'COMPLETED';
}

interface PollIndex {
  polls: Map<
    GuidV4,
    {
      currentCBL: ChecksumBuffer;
      previousVersions: ChecksumBuffer[];
      lastUpdate: Date;
    }
  >;
  replicationFactor: number;
  indexKeepers: GuidV4[];
}
```

## Open Questions

### Node Management

1. How should we handle partial node availability?

   - Node available for reads but not writes
   - Limited bandwidth scenarios
   - Geographic restrictions

2. What metrics should determine node reliability?

   - Simple uptime percentage
   - Weighted availability score
   - Performance metrics

3. How to handle network partitions?
   - Split brain scenarios
   - Partition recovery
   - Data consistency

### Data Replication

1. How to prioritize replication jobs?

   - Based on remaining copies
   - Based on data importance
   - Based on access patterns

2. What triggers replication?

   - Copy count below threshold
   - Predicted node failure
   - Geographic distribution

3. How to handle failed replications?
   - Retry strategies
   - Alternative node selection
   - Notification system

### Voting System

1. How to handle vote timing?

   - Synchronous vs asynchronous voting
   - Vote expiration
   - Time zones consideration

2. What's the relationship between polls and CBLs?

   - How often should CBLs be updated
   - Version history requirements
   - Index distribution

3. How to ensure vote privacy?
   - Encryption mechanisms
   - Vote verification
   - Result publication

## Implementation Considerations

### Node Communication

1. Protocol Selection

   - WebSocket vs HTTP
   - P2P protocols
   - Hybrid approach

2. Message Format

   - Binary vs JSON
