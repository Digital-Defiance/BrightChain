# BrightPass Password Manager

BrightPass is an enterprise-grade password keychain system built on BrightChain's encrypted block storage infrastructure. It provides vault management, credential CRUD, password generation, TOTP/2FA, breach detection, audit logging, emergency access, and import from popular password managers.

```

### Block Store Integration

BrightPass uses BrightChain's `IBlockStore` interface for persistent storage:

```typescript
// Testing (in-memory)
const blockStore = new MemoryBlockStore(BlockSize.Small);
const service = new BrightPassService(blockStore, vcblService, blockService, member);

// Production (disk-based) - drop-in replacement
const blockStore = new DiskBlockAsyncStore('/path/to/storage', BlockSize.Small);
const service = new BrightPassService(blockStore, vcblService, blockService, member);
```

### VCBL Storage Model

Storage uses the VCBL (Vault Constituent Block List), extending BrightChain's `ExtendedCBL` with a vault header and parallel `EntryPropertyRecord` array. This enables vault listing, searching, and filtering without decrypting individual entries.

- **VCBL Block**: Contains vault header, property records, and entry block addresses
- **Entry Blocks**: Individual encrypted blocks containing full credential data
- **Attachment Blocks**: Large files stored as encrypted blocks or CBLs

## Security Model

### Encryption (Hybrid Model - Industry Standard)

BrightPass uses the same hybrid encryption model as 1Password and Bitwarden:

**Symmetric (AES-256-GCM)**: Used for vault entries
- 12-byte IV (NIST SP 800-38D compliant)
- 16-byte authentication tag
- Fast and efficient for bulk data

**Asymmetric (ECIES)**: Used for key sharing and audit logs
- Vault key wrapped with recipient's public key when sharing
- Audit logs encrypted with system member's public key

### Key Derivation

Each vault has its own independent BIP39 mnemonic (24 words, 256-bit entropy):

```
Vault BIP39 Seed + Master Password
         ↓
    HKDF-SHA256 (with vault ID as info)
         ↓
   32-byte AES-256 Key
```

**Security Properties:**
- Independent: Each vault has its own BIP39 mnemonic
- Rotatable: `regenerateVaultSeed()` creates new mnemonic and re-encrypts all entries
- Domain separation: Vault ID prevents key reuse
- Forward secrecy: Master password change → new key derivation

### Password Hashing

Master passwords are hashed using bcrypt with 12 rounds (~300ms per hash):
- Constant-time comparison via `bcrypt.compare()`
- Salt automatically included by bcrypt
- Resistant to brute-force attacks

## API Endpoints

All endpoints are mounted under `/brightpass` and require JWT authentication.

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|

| POST | `/vaults/:vaultId/emergency-recover` | Recover vault with threshold shares |

### Import

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/vaults/:vaultId/import` | Import entries from external password manager |

## Entry Types

BrightPass supports four entry types:

- **login** — URL, username, password, optional TOTP secret
- **secure_note** — Free-form encrypted text
- **credit_card** — Cardholder name, number, expiration, CVV
- **identity** — First/last name, email, phone, address

## Password Generation

Configurable options:
- Length: 8–128 characters
- Character sets: uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols
- Minimum counts per character set
- Fisher-Yates shuffle using `crypto.randomBytes`

## Breach Detection

Uses the Have I Been Pwned API with k-anonymity:
1. SHA-1 hash the password
2. Send only the first 5 characters of the hash to the API
3. Compare the remaining 35 characters locally
4. Gracefully handles API unavailability

## Import Formats

Supported formats: 1Password (1PUX, CSV), LastPass CSV, Bitwarden (JSON, CSV), Chrome CSV, Firefox CSV, KeePass XML, Dashlane JSON.

Records are mapped to entry types based on their fields:
- Records with URL + username + password → `login`
- Records with card number + CVV → `credit_card`
- Records with first/last name → `identity`
- Everything else → `secure_note`

## Emergency Access

Uses Shamir's Secret Sharing (`@digitaldefiance/secrets`) to split the vault key into N shares with a configurable threshold T:

- Minimum threshold: 2 (enforced for security)
- Constant-time comparison for share verification
- Revocation invalidates all existing shares
- New shares generated with different polynomial

## Quorum Governance

Shared vaults can optionally require quorum governance. When configured with threshold T, opening the vault requires T member approvals before access is granted.

## Audit Logging

All vault operations are recorded in an append-only audit log stored as encrypted blocks:

- Vault created/opened/deleted/shared
- Entries created/read/updated/deleted
- Emergency access configured/recovered
- Quorum governance configured

Audit logs are encrypted with the system member's public key using ECIES.

## Testing

The implementation includes 80+ property-based tests validating correctness properties across all subsystems:

```bash
NX_TUI=false npx nx run brightchain-api-lib:test --outputStyle=stream
```
