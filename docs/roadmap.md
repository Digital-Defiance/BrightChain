# BrightChain Roadmap

* the maintainer of this project has had a sudden downturn in health and does not have as much time left as expected. previously expected to be around a few more years, but it may now be months. The project is considered mothballed.

## 1. Introduction

This roadmap outlines the further steps needed to achieve the project's goals. BrightChain aims to become the de facto international and interplanetary standard for data storage, identity, and digital contract fulfillment. The project has made significant progress, including the completion of the Owner Free Filesystem and the development of a complete cryptosystem that encompasses symmetrical and asymmetrical encryption as well as homomorphic encryption, all with key derivation techniques (ECIES + our custom Paillier key derivation).

## 2. Current State

BrightChain is in its initial stages. Key achievements include:

- **Completion of the Owner Free Filesystem**: The core concept of breaking files into source blocks and merging them with random data has been successfully implemented.
- **Development of a Complete Cryptosystem**: BrightChain has developed a complete cryptosystem that encompasses symmetrical and asymmetrical encryption as well as homomorphic encryption, all with key derivation techniques (ECIES + our custom Paillier key derivation).
- **Integration of Asynchronous Methods**: The codebase has been refactored to use asynchronous methods for checksum calculations, CRC operations, and block validation, ensuring consistency, improving performance, and enhancing error handling.
- **Improved Documentation**: All code files have complete JSDoc documentation, and the project documentation has been updated to reflect the current state of the project.

## 3. Short-Term Goals (Next 6 Months)
